# Introduction to Computing for the Social Sciences
[David Garcia](http://dgarcia.eu)


## About this course

This introductory course on computation is designed to expose social science students 
with no background in computing to the fundamental concepts of computer science, basics of
programming, and their role in the social sciences and society. We will be covering a gamut 
of topics starting from a basic overview of computer systems, information coding, and storage, 
to data structures, algorithms, and database systems. The course has a special emphasis on a
social informatics perspective to illustrate the applications of computing in the social sciences,
the role of computer science in society, and how social and historical forces have shaped informatics. 
Theoretical lectures will be accompanied by practical programming exercises (in Python programming language) 
that will allow students to directly apply the acquired knowledge to application scenarios relevant to the social 
sciences. The main goal of the course is to equip students with sufficient basic conceptual understanding of
computer science and programming to be able to solve problems computationally.

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and use ideas at the core of computer science and programming
- Demonstrate familiarity with major algorithms and data structures
- Use computational techniques for solving problems in the social sciences
- Have familiarity with Python programming language for simple computational tasks

The course has three types of sessions:

- **Lectures:** The course has a weekly, mandatory 90-minute lecture that introduces concepts and foundations 
in computer science. The slides for these lectures are made available on Ilias the day before the lecture takes place.
- **Exercises:** The course includes optional extra 90-minute sessions to discuss both pen-and-paper and practical 
coding exercises. These are aligned with the lectures and help to bridge theory and practice. Exercise sheets and 
notebooks will be distributed over Ilias in advance and will serve as the basis for these sessions. These exercises
help both as practice for the final written exam and to develop skills for the final projects.
- **Tutorials:** Tutorials help students to apply fundamental concepts of computer science in Python. Tutorial sessions 
serve as contact points for students to develop practical skills and to work and discuss solutions on programming assignments
in the Python programming language. There will be two tutorial groups covering the same content each week. You don't have to
register to a group and we will only ask for registration if attendance is very imbalanced.

## Who am I?

I am the Professor for Social and Behavioral Data Science at the University of Konstanz. My background is Computer Science but I worked my whole career with psychologists, sociologists and physicists 
to learn new ways to understand human behavior. I got my PhD from ETH Zurich in 2012 and a habilitation in 2018, starting to work as 
full professor TU Graz in 2020 and then at the University of Konstanz in 2022. To learn more about my work, check my
